As an environmentalist, it is one of my aims to bring attention to some of our world's issues. Unfortunately for us, many animals are facing extinction due to our actions, many plants are dying, many forests are burning, many seas are ravaged in plastic and too little action is being taken to help prosper our beautiful world. The impacts of our actions will one day come to bite us and Time Will Not Forgive Us.

I've built this website to highlight these issues, with the hope being that it will inspire people all across the world to take action. Every little we do to protect our planet is a win for us in the future as well as future generations.

This project initially started as TheOdinProject's recipe website assignement, hence the initial commits including lasanga and pasta. However I quickly realised that if I want to build a website that the world is going to see, I would rather make it be impactful and make a difference rather than be yet another boring recipe website.

The project includes HTML, CSS and Javascript to make the website come to life.
