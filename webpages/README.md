As an environmentalist, it is one of my aims to bring attention to some of our world's issues. Unfortunately for us, many animals are facing extinction due to our actions, many plants are dying, many forests are burning and too little action is being taken to help prosper our beautiful world.

I've built this website to highlight these issues.

The project includes HTML, CSS and Javascript to make the website come to life.
